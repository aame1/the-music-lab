### Intro 

Welcome to this README.md 


I wanted to try and make this first page interactive and funny for those who want to _hopefully_ learn something new about *music* history. Although, the page is just an ambitious attempt because all I am going to do is implement some HTML & CSS learned during my study at HackYourFuture that I'm quite enjoying. 

The page will be developed using user stories in an agile approach, with very small changes and a step-by-step committment using different branches for each section of the pages. 

How we want to look it?

If you just came across this website from a mysterious place in our lovely although suffering planet - where I hope you're safe and healthy - then I  hope you'll enjoy. 


#### But, now that you're here, at least let me know you were. 

##### How ?
