# Development Strategy

> `the-music-lab`

A simple website dedicated to those who want to learn some interesting fact in the history of music.

- people that are passionate about music.
- it's an original approach where I will bring a puzzle to solve.

## Wireframe

<!-- include a wireframe for your project in this repository, and display it here -->
<!-- wireframe.cc is a good site for getting started with wireframes -->

## 0. Set-Up

__A User can see my initial repository and live demo__

### Repo

- Generate from Template
- Write initial, basic README
- Turn on GitHub Pages

## 1. User Story: Adding the files and folders

__As a frontend developer, I will already add the needed files and folders that I'm going to work with__

### Repo

I created a branch called files-folders and put them in their respective directories.


### 2. User Story: Adding the global body element 

__As a visitor, I want to see a body with a background color and fixed font__

### Repo

Created a branch called `main-body`

### HTML

Nothing at this point. The template for HTML tags was generated by using the `!` Emmet shortcut.

### CSS

Added font, padding, margin and a background color. 

## 3. User Story: Adding meta tags in <head>, identity and linking stylesheet

__As a web developer I want a website that is SEO friendly, responsive and with needed styles.

## Repo 

- Added a branch called head-metatags

### HTML

Added meta tags, title, link rel to the stylesheet folder.

### CSS

Still nothing at this point.

## 4. User Story: Adding a distinct header

__As a visitor, I want to add the semantic element <header> to the page.__

## Repo

I added a branch called `header` and fetched the <nav> files from branch `files-folders`.

### HTML 

- Created section called header according to the semantic and the wireframe. 
- added divs and nav tags with subpages.

### CSS

Added css for all the header section and didn't intervene yet in the .container div class because I might need <br>
it later on for the global aspect of the page.

## 5. User-Story: Adding a section to the page 

__As a visitor, I want to see a proper introduction to the web page, to understand what is it about__

### HTML 

I added
