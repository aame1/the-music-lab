# Development Strategy

> `the-music-lab`

A simple website dedicated to those who want to learn some interesting fact in the history of music.

- people that are passionate about music.
- it's an original approach where I will bring a puzzle to solve.

## 0. Set-Up

__A User can see my initial repository and live demo__

### Repo

- Generate from Template
- Write initial, basic README
- Turn on GitHub Pages

## 1. User Story: Adding the files and folders

__As a frontend developer, I will already add the needed files and folders that I'm going to work with__

### Repo

I created a branch called files-folders and put them in their respective directories.

### HTML

None. Because i didn't make any changes. 

### CSS

None. Because i didn't make any changes. 

## 2. As a visitor, I want to see a body with a background color and fixed font.

### Repo

Created a branch called `main-body`

### HTML

Nothing at this point. The template for HTML tags was generated by using the `!` Emmet shortcut.

### CSS

Added font, padding, margin and a background color.
