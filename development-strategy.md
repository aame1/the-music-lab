# Development Strategy

> `the-music-lab`

A simple website dedicated to those who want to learn some interesting fact in the history of music.

- people that are passionate about music.
- it's an original approach where I will bring a puzzle to solve.

## Wireframe

<!-- include a wireframe for your project in this repository, and display it here -->
<!-- wireframe.cc is a good site for getting started with wireframes -->

## 0. Set-Up

__A User can see my initial repository and live demo__

### Repo

- Generate from Template
- Write initial, basic README
- Turn on GitHub Pages

## 1. User Story: Adding the files and folders

__As a frontend developer, I will already add the needed files and folders that I'm going to work with__

### Repo

I created a branch called files-folders and put them in their respective directories.


### 2. User Story: Adding the global body element 

__As a visitor, I want to see a body with a background color and fixed font__

### Repo

Created a branch called `main-body`

### HTML

Nothing at this point. The template for HTML tags was generated by using the `!` Emmet shortcut.

### CSS

Added font, padding, margin and a background color. 

## 3. User Story: Adding meta tags in <head>, identity and linking stylesheet

__As a web developer I want a website that is SEO friendly, responsive and with needed styles.

## Repo 

- Added a branch called head-metatags

### HTML

Added meta tags, title, link rel to the stylesheet folder.

### CSS

Still nothing at this point.

## 4. User Story: Adding a distinct header

__As a visitor, I want to add the semantic element <header> to the page.__

## Repo

I added a branch called `header` and fetched the `<nav>` files from branch `files-folders`.

### HTML 

- Created section called header according to the semantic and the wireframe. 
- added divs and nav tags with subpages.

### CSS

Added css for all the header section and didn't intervene yet in the .container div class because I might need <br>
it later on for the global aspect of the page.

## 5. User-Story: Adding a section to the page 

__As a visitor, I want to see a proper introduction to the web page, to understand what is it about__

### Repo

Worked on branch `section-1`

### HTML 

I added a small introduction with the purpose of the website by using a separate section.<br>

I didn't see the need of making a `<div>` for a container.

### CSS 

Added height and padding-bottom so that the section below is "glued" together with the first section. Other styles added for the looks and feels.

6. ## User Story: Interaction with the visitor

__As a visitor, I wanted to interact with the website__

### Repo 

I created a `section-2` branch.

### HTML

I added a simple Pull Request button, so that the user can submit its solution onto the github webpage. 

### CSS

- Added an id #submit-answers to the whole section
- Added a #pull-request id for the `<a>` tag with hovering options. 

7. ## User Story: Adding the Hints

__As a visitor, I want to see a picture connected to the "puzzle" in the main page__

### Repo

I created a `section 3` branch and I also made some changes on `section-1` because I had issues with the padding. In between the two sections a small space that I neeeded to fix by adding a `{padding-bottom:10px}` 

### HTML 

- I added another section with a particular id to only affect this section.
- I added the .box class to make it more controllable. 

### CSS 

- Added styling to the box. 
- Added padding to match it with `section-1` 


## 8. User Story:  As a visitor, I want to see who made this page 

## Repo

__ Added a footer tag on every page (`footer`, `adjustments` and `footer-learnmore` that points to my github profile and a HackYourFuture website. 


## 9 User Story: Navigation to different tabs

__As a user, I would like to check other pages of this website__

### Repo: 

- Added repo `puzzle-heads`, `puzzle-section` + for final adjustments, i created a repo called `adjustments`

### HTML 

- Copied heads and first section from the index.html because it was similar. 


### CSS 

On `adjustments` repo, i changed the look and feel of the website, and when I copied the page from index.html, I just used the same styles from index.html


10. User Story: As a visitor, i want a better presentation of the article sections 

## Repo 

Created repo `section-article` and also made some small adjustments on repo `adjustments`. 

### HTML 

I created the section first then the articles with a h2 (mandatory to pass the validator w3 check)

### CSS 

I added a border-radius to distinct the different paragraphs of the page and also, I created an `<aside>` tag separated from the rest.

11. ## User Story: Interacting the web developer 

__As a visitor, i want to interact with the creator of the website__

## Repo

- Added a `subscription-email`
-
